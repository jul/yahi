Plotting the result with flask
==============================

Here is a sample of the website I run with the data that results from yahi
on an intel atom on my DSL (for fun): 
http://wwwstat.julbox.fr/

The sources are here: 
https://github.com/jul/yahi/tree/master/www

The work is still in development, since I had harder time writing the doc 
than the code.
