Ploting histograms or time series from CSV

================================
CSV that can be parsed as regexp
================================

There are simple cases when CSV don't have strings embedded and are litteraly comma separated integers/floats.

In this case, CSV can be parsed as a regexp and it's all the more convenient when the CSV has no title.

Here is an example using the CSV coming from the CSV generated by `trollometre <https://github.com/jul/trollometre/>`_

A line is made off a timestamp followed by various (int) counters.

.. tip:: For the sake of ease of use I hacked the date_pattern format to accept "%s" as a timestamp (while it's normally
    only valid strptime formater)


.. literalinclude:: test.py

Then, all that remains to do is ::

    yahi_all_in_one_maker && firefox aio.html

You click on time series and can see the either the chronological time serie

Or the profile by hour

================================
Raw approach with csv.DictReader
================================

Let's take the use case where my job insurance sent me the data of all the 10000 jobless persons
in my vicinity consisting for each line of :

opaque id,civility,firstname, lastname, email,email of the counseler following the job less person


For this CSV, I have the title as the first line, and have strings that may countain ",", hence the regexp approach
is strongly ill advised.

What we want here is 2 histograms :

- the frequency of the firstname (that does not violates RGPD) and that I can share,
- how much each adviser is counseling.

Here is the code 

.. literalinclude:: test2.py

Then, all that remains to do is ::

    yahi_all_in_one_maker && firefox aio.html

And here we can see that each counseler is following on average ~250 jobless persons.

.. image:: csv_3.png

And the frequency of the firstname

.. image:: csv_4.png

Which correlated with the demographic of the firstname as included here below tends to prove
that the older you are the less likeky you are to be jobless.

I am not saying *ageism*, the data are doing it for me.
